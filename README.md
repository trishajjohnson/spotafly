# FINAL CAPSTONE: SPOTAFLY APP

Spotafly is a music discovery app, similar to Spotify, where users can join the site by registering an account, creating a username and password.  After registering, a user may search for music, either by artist, song, album or genre.  Users may navigate to artist’s profiles or browse and like album tracks.  Once a song is liked, the user may navigate to their own profile and view their favorite songs in a playlist.  From within discovery, users may also create new playlists and add songs to playlists.  Once playlists are created, the user may view their playlists on their profile.  Similar to albums, when clicked, users may navigate to a playlist’s detail page and view the tracks added to it.  From there, the user may remove songs or delete a playlist entirely.

The goal of this project is to provide an application for users to discover new artists, find their favorite artists’ music, and build playlists.  The application is an evenly focused full stack web application, geared at serving a wide demographic of music lovers.  The application utilizes music data collected from the Spotify API.  The frontend is built with HTML, CSS and React, while the backend is built with Express and Node.

## Deployment

The backend application is deployed with Heroku and can be found here: https://app-spotafly.herokuapp.com/.  Frontend is deployed with Surge.

## Tests

Unit and integration tests were written with Jest and Supertest, and can be found in the front and backend.  Tests can be run by using the command 'jest NAME_OF_FILE'.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
